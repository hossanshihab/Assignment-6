Project name: PET HOUSE Peddy - Pet Adoption Platform

Pet Adoption Portal: A free online animal shelter management software designed for animal welfare organizations.
PetRehomer: An online pet adoption website where people who want to adopt a pet connect with people who need to rehome their pets.

1. Responsive Design:
Ensure the website is fully responsive across all devices
(desktops, tablets, and mobile phones) using CSS frameworks
like TailwindCSS and responsive design principles.

2. Dynamic Pet Listings:
Implement functionality to dynamically load and display pet cards based on categories.

3. Adoption Process Integration:
Create a straightforward adoption process where users can click on an "Adopt" button on each pet card

4. Pet Profiles with Detailed Information:
Create individual pet profile pages that provide in-depth information about each pet. This can include details like age, breed

5. Pet Data API:
Use an API (like the Peddy API you mentioned) to retrieve
real-time data about available pets, including images, descriptions, and adoption status.
